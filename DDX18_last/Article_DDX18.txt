AB  - OBJECTIVES: The noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play important roles in gastric cancer. 
      Most studies have focused on the functions and influence of ncRNAs, but seldom on 
      their maturation. DEAD box genes are a family of RNA-binding proteins that may 
      influence the development of ncRNAs, which attracted our attention. By combining 
      a small sample for high-throughput gene microarray screening with large samples 
      of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and our cohort, we aimed to find some 
      gastric cancer-related genes. We evaluated the clinical significance and 
      prognostic value of candidate gene DDX18, which is overexpressed in gastric 
      cancer tissues. To provide a theoretical basis for the development of new 
      therapeutic targets for the treatment of gastric cancer, we investigated its 
      effect on the malignant biological behavior of gastric cancer in vitro and in 
      vivo, and also discuss its mechanism of action. METHODS: (i) The differential 
      profiling of mRNA expression in five pairs of gastric cancer and adjacent normal 
      tissues was studied by Arraystar Human mRNA Microarray. By combining this with 
      TCGA data and our cohort, we finally filtered out DDX18, which was upregulated in 
      gastric cancer tissues, for further investigation. (ii) The protein expression of 
      DDX18 was detected by immunohistochemistry staining. Then the relationship 
      between the DDX18 expression level and the clinicopathological data and prognosis 
      was analyzed. (iii) A CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay were used to 
      evaluate the effect of DDX18 on cell growth and proliferation in vitro. A 
      transwell assay was also performed to examine the migration and invasion of 
      gastric cancer cells. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by using a fluorescein 
      isothiocyanate-annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining assay. To identify the 
      role of DDX18 in the tumorigenic ability of gastric cancer cells in vivo, we also 
      established a subcutaneous gastric cancer xenograft model. Coimmunoprecipitation, 
      small RNAseq, and western blotting were performed to explore the mechanism of 
      action of DDX18 in gastric cancer. A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model was 
      used to confirm the effect of DDX18 in gastric cancer tissues. RESULT: (i) DDX18 
      was upregulated in gastric cancer tumor tissues from a TCGA database and our 
      cohort. The expression of DDX18 was also closely related to tumor volume, 
      Borrmann classification, degree of tumor differentiation, cancer embolus, lymph 
      node metastasis, and TNM stage. (ii) DDX18 could promote cell proliferation, 
      migration, and invasion and inhibit cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. (iii) 
      DDX18 could promote the maturation of microRNA-21 through direct interaction with 
      Drosha, decreasing PTEN, which could upregulate the AKT signaling pathway. (iv) 
      The PDX model showed that DDX18 could promote the proliferation of gastric cancer 
      tissues by means of the PTEN-AKT signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: (i) DDX18 can be 
      treated as a molecular marker to assess the prognosis of patients with gastric 
      cancer. (ii) DDX18 could be a potential therapeutic target in gastric cancer.

PG  - 549-56
AB  - Helicases are present in viruses, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes, and several of 
      them have been linked to human diseases. Here we study the role of one putative 
      DEAD-box RNA helicase, MrDb (DDX18), in tumor cells. We show that MrDb is a 
      nucleolar protein ubiquitously expressed in tumor cells and that it is more 
      abundantly expressed in proliferating cells. Inhibition of MrDb with dominant 
      negative mutant or a shRNA reduces tumor cell proliferation without inducing a 
      cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. These findings suggest that MrDb is important for 
      cell proliferation and that its inhibition could prevent tumor cell 
      proliferation.

AB  - Diabetes, a metabolic disease characterized by high blood glucose and other 
      complications, has undefined causes and multiple risk factors, including 
      inappropriate diet, unhealthy lifestyles, and genetic predisposition. The two 
      most distinguished types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes, resulting 
      from the autoimmune impairment of insulin-generating pancreatic β cells and 
      insulin insensitivity, respectively. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), a cohort of RNAs 
      with little transcriptional value, have been found to exert substantial 
      importance in epigenetic and posttranscriptional modulation of gene expression 
      such as messenger RNA (mRNA) silencing. This review mainly focuses on the 
      pathology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and ncRNAs as potential biomarkers in T2D 
      development and clinical management. We consolidate the pathogenesis, diagnosis, 
      and current treatments of T2D, and present the existing evidence on changes in 
      multiple types of ncRNAs in response to various pathological changes and 
      dysfunctions in different stages of T2D.

TI  - The First Genome-Wide Association Study for Type 2 Diabetes in Youth: The 
      Progress in Diabetes Genetics in Youth (ProDiGY) Consortium.
PG  - 996-1005
LID - 10.2337/db20-0443 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in youth has increased substantially, yet the 
      genetic underpinnings remain largely unexplored. To identify genetic variants 
      predisposing to youth-onset type 2 diabetes, we formed ProDiGY, a multiethnic 
      collaboration of three studies (TODAY, SEARCH, and T2D-GENES) with 3,006 youth 
      case subjects with type 2 diabetes (mean age 15.1 ± 2.9 years) and 6,061 
      diabetes-free adult control subjects (mean age 54.2 ± 12.4 years). After 
      stratifying by principal component-clustered ethnicity, we performed association 
      analyses on ∼10 million imputed variants using a generalized linear mixed model 
      incorporating a genetic relationship matrix to account for population structure 
      and adjusting for sex. We identified seven genome-wide significant loci, 
      including the novel locus rs10992863 in PHF2 (P = 3.2 × 10(-8); odds ratio [OR] = 
      1.23). Known loci identified in our analysis include rs7903146 in TCF7L2 (P = 8.0 
      × 10(-20); OR 1.58), rs72982988 near MC4R (P = 4.4 × 10(-14); OR 1.53), 
      rs200893788 in CDC123 (P = 1.1 × 10(-12); OR 1.32), rs2237892 in KCNQ1 (P = 4.8 × 
      10(-11); OR 1.59), rs937589119 in IGF2BP2 (P = 3.1 × 10(-9); OR 1.34), and 
      rs113748381 in SLC16A11 (P = 4.1 × 10(-8); OR 1.04). Secondary analysis with 856 
      diabetes-free youth control subjects uncovered an additional locus in CPEB2 (P = 
      3.2 × 10(-8); OR 2.1) and consistent direction of effect for diabetes risk. In 
      conclusion, we identified both known and novel loci in the first genome-wide 
      association study of youth-onset type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Fine-mapping type 2 diabetes loci to single-variant resolution using high-density 
      imputation and islet-specific epigenome maps.
PG  - 1505-1513
LID - 10.1038/s41588-018-0241-6 [doi]
AB  - We expanded GWAS discovery for type 2 diabetes (T2D) by combining data from 
      898,130 European-descent individuals (9% cases), after imputation to high-density 
      reference panels. With these data, we (i) extend the inventory of T2D-risk 
      variants (243 loci, 135 newly implicated in T2D predisposition, comprising 403 
      distinct association signals); (ii) enrich discovery of lower-frequency risk 
      alleles (80 index variants with minor allele frequency <5%, 14 with estimated 
      allelic odds ratio >2); (iii) substantially improve fine-mapping of causal 
      variants (at 51 signals, one variant accounted for >80% posterior probability of 
      association (PPA)); (iv) extend fine-mapping through integration of 
      tissue-specific epigenomic information (islet regulatory annotations extend the 
      number of variants with PPA >80% to 73); (v) highlight validated therapeutic 
      targets (18 genes with associations attributable to coding variants); and (vi) 
      demonstrate enhanced potential for clinical translation (genome-wide chip 
      heritability explains 18% of T2D risk; individuals in the extremes of a T2D 
      polygenic risk score differ more than ninefold in prevalence).
