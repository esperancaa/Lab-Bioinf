15727801,IRS-1 and vascular complications in diabetes mellitus.,"The expected explosive increase in the number of patients with diabetes mellitus will increase the stress on health care. Treatment is focused on preventing vascular complications associated with the disorder. In order to develop better treatment regimens, the field of research has made a great effort in understanding this disorder. This chapter summarizes the current views on the insulin signaling pathway with emphasis on intracellular signaling events associated with insulin resistance, which lead to the prothrombotic condition in the vasculature of patience with diabetes mellitus.","['Andrade Ferreira I', 'Akkerman JW']",Vitam Horm. 2005;70:25-67. doi: 10.1016/S0083-6729(05)70002-9.
14584587,IRS-1 regulation in health and disease.,"The global incidence of diabetes is increasing at epidemic rates. Estimates suggest there are currently 150 million people with diabetes and this number is expected to double in the next 20 years. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95% of all cases and is characterized in part by impaired sensitivity to insulin or 'insulin resistance'. Defects in the insulin signalling pathways underpin this resistance. In the current article we discuss the regulation of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1), a protein that plays a pivotal role in insulin signalling and whose function is impaired in subjects with insulin resistance. Coordination of IRS-1 function is multi-faceted, involving phosphorylation of IRS-1 at multiple serine/threonine residues. This controls many aspects of IRS-1, including its interaction with the insulin receptor and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as its subcellular distribution and targeting for degradation by the proteasome. Such tight control ensures appropriate transduction and attenuation of the insulin signal, thereby regulating insulin action in healthy individuals. Emerging evidence indicates that 'diabetogenic factors' associated with insulin resistance, such as TNFalpha and elevated circulating fatty acids, impact on insulin signalling at the level of IRS-1 serine/threonine phosphorylation. The expression and/or activity of several kinases, such as IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) and salt-induced kinase 2 (SIK2), and the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at key sites, such as Ser307 and Ser789, are increased in states of insulin resistance. Identifying the pathways by which such factors activate these and other kinases, and defining the precise roles of specific serine/ threonine phosphorylation events in IRS-1 regulation, represent important goals which may eventually provide a rationale for therapeutic intervention.","['Schmitz-Peiffer C', 'Whitehead JP']",IUBMB Life. 2003 Jul;55(7):367-74. doi: 10.1080/1521654031000138569.
26704265,Novel compounds reducing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation for treatment of diabetes.,"Activation of various interacting stress kinases, particularly the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and a concomitant phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) at serine 307 play a central role both in insulin resistance and in β-cell dysfunction. IRS-1 phosphorylation is stimulated by elevated free fatty acid levels through different pathways in obesity. A series of novel pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one derivatives were synthesized as potential antidiabetic agents, preventing IRS-1 phosphorylation at serine 307 in a cellular model of lipotoxicity and type 2 diabetes.","['Simon-Szabó L', 'Kokas M', 'Greff Z', 'Boros S', 'Bánhegyi P', 'Zsákai L', 'Szántai-Kis C', 'Vantus T', 'Mandl J', 'Bánhegyi G', 'Vályi-Nagy I', 'Őrfi L', 'Ullrich A', 'Csala M', 'Kéri G']",Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2016 Jan 15;26(2):424-428. doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2015.11.099.

12169433,IRS proteins and the common path to diabetes.,"Although a full understanding of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) action is evolving, the discovery of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and their role to link cell surface receptors to the intracellular signaling cascades provided an important step forward. Moreover, Insulin/IGF receptors use common signaling pathways to accomplish many tasks, the IRS proteins add a unique layer of specificity and control. Importantly, the IRS-2 branch of the insulin/IGF-signaling pathway is a common element in peripheral insulin response and pancreatic beta-cell growth and function. Failure of IRS-2 signaling might explain the eventual loss of compensatory hyperinsulinemia during prolonged periods of peripheral insulin resistance. Moreover, short-term inhibition of IRS protein functions by serine phosphorylation, or sustained inhibition by ubiquitin-targeted proteosome-mediated degradation suggests a common molecular mechanism for insulin resistance during acute injury or infection, or the sensitivity of beta-cells to autoimmune destruction. The broad role of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in cell growth and survival reveals a common regulatory pathway linking development, somatic growth, fertility, neuronal proliferation, and aging to the core mechanisms used by vertebrates for nutrient sensing.",['White MF'],Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 2002 Sep;283(3):E413-22. doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.00514.2001.
10593864,Low cellular IRS 1 gene and protein expression predict insulin resistance and NIDDM.,"We examined the gene and protein expression of IRS 1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) in adipocytes from two groups of healthy individuals with an increased propensity for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): those with two first-degree relatives with diabetes and another group with massive obesity. A low expression of IRS 1 (</=50% of the matched control group) was seen in approximately 30% of both groups and these individuals were characterized by insulin resistance and its hallmarks: higher levels of insulin, glucose, and triglycerides. Two individuals with previously unknown NIDDM were diagnosed and both had low IRS 1 expression. Low IRS 1 protein expression was associated with low mRNA levels but not with the common Gly972Arg polymorphism of the IRS 1 gene. Taken together, our present and previous findings show that a low expression of IRS 1 in fat cells predicts insulin resistance and NIDDM. Furthermore, they support the likelihood that an impaired transcriptional activation may play a key role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM.-Carvalho, E., Jansson, P.-A., Axelsen, M., Eriksson, J.

11272176,IRS proteins and beta-cell function.,"Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins mediate a variety of the metabolic and growth-promoting actions of insulin and IGF-1. After phosphorylation by activated receptors, these intracellular signaling molecules recruit various downstream effector pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Grb2. Ablation of the IRS-2 gene produces a diabetic phenotype; mice lacking IRS-2 display peripheral insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction characterized by a 50% reduction in beta-cell mass. In contrast, deletion of IRS-1 retards somatic growth and enhances beta-cell mass. IRS1-/- mice are 50% smaller than controls but have a twofold increase in pancreatic beta-cell mass. Thus, observations from these recently developed animal models implicate the IRS signaling systems in the response of classical insulin target tissues, and they suggest a critical role for these proteins in the regulation of beta-cell function. In humans, type 2 diabetes generally occurs when insulin-secretory reserves fail to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance. Study and identification of the signals downstream of IRS proteins in beta-cells may provide unique insights into the compensatory mechanisms by which these cells respond to insulin resistance. Therefore, the intent of this review is to summarize recent observations regarding the regulation of beta-cell function by members of the IRS protein family.","['Burks DJ', 'White MF']",Diabetes. 2001 Feb;50 Suppl 1:S140-5. doi: 10.2337/diabetes.50.2007.s140.
