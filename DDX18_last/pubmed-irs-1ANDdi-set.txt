TI  - IRS-1 and vascular complications in diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 25-67
AB  - The expected explosive increase in the number of patients with diabetes mellitus 
      will increase the stress on health care. Treatment is focused on preventing 
      vascular complications associated with the disorder. In order to develop better 
      treatment regimens, the field of research has made a great effort in 
      understanding this disorder. This chapter summarizes the current views on the 
      insulin signaling pathway with emphasis on intracellular signaling events 
      associated with insulin resistance, which lead to the prothrombotic condition in 
      the vasculature of patience with diabetes mellitus.

AB  - The global incidence of diabetes is increasing at epidemic rates. Estimates 
      suggest there are currently 150 million people with diabetes and this number is 
      expected to double in the next 20 years. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95% of all 
      cases and is characterized in part by impaired sensitivity to insulin or 'insulin 
      resistance'. Defects in the insulin signalling pathways underpin this resistance. 
      In the current article we discuss the regulation of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 
      (IRS-1), a protein that plays a pivotal role in insulin signalling and whose 
      function is impaired in subjects with insulin resistance. Coordination of IRS-1 
      function is multi-faceted, involving phosphorylation of IRS-1 at multiple 
      serine/threonine residues. This controls many aspects of IRS-1, including its 
      interaction with the insulin receptor and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation, as 
      well as its subcellular distribution and targeting for degradation by the 
      proteasome. Such tight control ensures appropriate transduction and attenuation 
      of the insulin signal, thereby regulating insulin action in healthy individuals. 
      Emerging evidence indicates that 'diabetogenic factors' associated with insulin 
      resistance, such as TNFalpha and elevated circulating fatty acids, impact on 
      insulin signalling at the level of IRS-1 serine/threonine phosphorylation. The 
      expression and/or activity of several kinases, such as IkappaB kinase beta 
      (IKKbeta) and salt-induced kinase 2 (SIK2), and the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at 
      key sites, such as Ser307 and Ser789, are increased in states of insulin 
      resistance. Identifying the pathways by which such factors activate these and 
      other kinases, and defining the precise roles of specific serine/ threonine 
      phosphorylation events in IRS-1 regulation, represent important goals which may 
      eventually provide a rationale for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Activation of various interacting stress kinases, particularly the c-Jun 
      N-terminal kinases (JNK), and a concomitant phosphorylation of insulin receptor 
      substrate 1 (IRS-1) at serine 307 play a central role both in insulin resistance 
      and in β-cell dysfunction. IRS-1 phosphorylation is stimulated by elevated free 
      fatty acid levels through different pathways in obesity. A series of novel 
      pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one derivatives were synthesized as potential 
      antidiabetic agents, preventing IRS-1 phosphorylation at serine 307 in a cellular 
      model of lipotoxicity and type 2 diabetes.

TI  - IRS proteins and the common path to diabetes.
PG  - E413-22
AB  - Although a full understanding of insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) action 
      is evolving, the discovery of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and their 
      role to link cell surface receptors to the intracellular signaling cascades 
      provided an important step forward. Moreover, Insulin/IGF receptors use common 
      signaling pathways to accomplish many tasks, the IRS proteins add a unique layer 
      of specificity and control. Importantly, the IRS-2 branch of the 
      insulin/IGF-signaling pathway is a common element in peripheral insulin response 
      and pancreatic beta-cell growth and function. Failure of IRS-2 signaling might 
      explain the eventual loss of compensatory hyperinsulinemia during prolonged 
      periods of peripheral insulin resistance. Moreover, short-term inhibition of IRS 
      protein functions by serine phosphorylation, or sustained inhibition by 
      ubiquitin-targeted proteosome-mediated degradation suggests a common molecular 
      mechanism for insulin resistance during acute injury or infection, or the 
      sensitivity of beta-cells to autoimmune destruction. The broad role of IRS-1 and 
      IRS-2 in cell growth and survival reveals a common regulatory pathway linking 
      development, somatic growth, fertility, neuronal proliferation, and aging to the 
      core mechanisms used by vertebrates for nutrient sensing.

TI  - Low cellular IRS 1 gene and protein expression predict insulin resistance and 
      NIDDM.
PG  - 2173-8
AB  - We examined the gene and protein expression of IRS 1 (insulin receptor substrate 
      1) in adipocytes from two groups of healthy individuals with an increased 
      propensity for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM): those with two 
      first-degree relatives with diabetes and another group with massive obesity. A 
      low expression of IRS 1 (</=50% of the matched control group) was seen in 
      approximately 30% of both groups and these individuals were characterized by 
      insulin resistance and its hallmarks: higher levels of insulin, glucose, and 
      triglycerides. Two individuals with previously unknown NIDDM were diagnosed and 
      both had low IRS 1 expression. Low IRS 1 protein expression was associated with 
      low mRNA levels but not with the common Gly972Arg polymorphism of the IRS 1 gene. 
      Taken together, our present and previous findings show that a low expression of 
      IRS 1 in fat cells predicts insulin resistance and NIDDM. Furthermore, they 
      support the likelihood that an impaired transcriptional activation may play a key 
      role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM.-Carvalho, E., Jansson, P.-A., Axelsen, M., 
      Eriksson, J. W., Huang, X., Groop, L., Rondinone, C., Sjöström, L., Smith, U. Low

TI  - IRS proteins and beta-cell function.
PG  - S140-5
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins mediate a variety of the metabolic and 
      growth-promoting actions of insulin and IGF-1. After phosphorylation by activated 
      receptors, these intracellular signaling molecules recruit various downstream 
      effector pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Grb2. Ablation of 
      the IRS-2 gene produces a diabetic phenotype; mice lacking IRS-2 display 
      peripheral insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction characterized by a 50% 
      reduction in beta-cell mass. In contrast, deletion of IRS-1 retards somatic 
      growth and enhances beta-cell mass. IRS1-/- mice are 50% smaller than controls 
      but have a twofold increase in pancreatic beta-cell mass. Thus, observations from 
      these recently developed animal models implicate the IRS signaling systems in the 
      response of classical insulin target tissues, and they suggest a critical role 
      for these proteins in the regulation of beta-cell function. In humans, type 2 
      diabetes generally occurs when insulin-secretory reserves fail to compensate for 
      peripheral insulin resistance. Study and identification of the signals downstream 
      of IRS proteins in beta-cells may provide unique insights into the compensatory 
      mechanisms by which these cells respond to insulin resistance. Therefore, the 
      intent of this review is to summarize recent observations regarding the 
      regulation of beta-cell function by members of the IRS protein family.
