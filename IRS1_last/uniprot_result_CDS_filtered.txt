P35568	Homo sapiens (Human)	Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)		FUNCTION: May mediate the control of various cellular processes by insulin. When phosphorylated by the insulin receptor binds specifically to various cellular proteins containing SH2 domains such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit or GRB2. Activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase when bound to the regulatory p85 subunit (By similarity). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150}.
