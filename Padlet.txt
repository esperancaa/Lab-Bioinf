Aim of the project: Analyse IRS1, GLI2 and DDX18 as potencially related to diabetes II, using bioinformatic tools. 

Methodoly

Our group decided to completely automate the initial part of the investigation and homology analysis: 
-Searching for literature, 
-finding the nucleotide and proteic sequence 
The automation of the process consists in getting all the info from Biopython scripts, instead of jumping from Web to Web browser searches. So, all 
necessary information (filtered by algorythms) is saved in files, with the necessary format. This made possible to analyse several things at the same
time for all found proteins (of different organisms) and compare them with each other and with the phylogenetic tree. 
-Protein function
-Subcelular location

Next, we used the filtered files directly in:
-Motif MEME
-FIMO
-STRING
-IntAct
-NetPhos
-TMHMM
-Phobius
